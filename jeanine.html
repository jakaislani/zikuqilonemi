Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve had a soft spot in my heart for heart-shaped treats. As an adult, it’s one of the most special holidays that Jack and I celebrate. Traditionally, it’s the one night a year that he cooks by himself, and whatever he decides to make is always a surprise. His trip to the grocery store, with zero guidance, is an approximately 2-hour adventure, and by the time dinner is done, every pot in the kitchen has been used. Suffice it to say that we’ve…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>It’s game day week! Not that we’re big sports fans, but I&nbsp;am a big fan of any day where it’s perfectly acceptable to eat all of the spicy, salsa-smothered, avocado-filled foods that I crave. So I’m sharing my healthier versions of traditional party favorites that don’t sacrifice in flavor because, well, foods like avocados, black beans, spicy peppers, and fresh salsa just taste good and are good for you! Chipotle Cauliflower Nachos with Pineapple Salsa&nbsp;(pictured above) The star of this nacho recipe is the oozy, smoky chipotle cauliflower “cheese.” Yep, that’s right, the queso you see pictured is actually a…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>I’ve been keeping this a secret for a while now, but today’s the day that I can finally tell you about my new cookbook, Love & Lemons Every Day! The main thing that I want you to know about it is that, well… it’s packed with all of my absolute favorite recipes, ones I’ve been obsessively making, eating, serving, and testing nearly every day for the past three years. It’s a big fat beautiful book packed with all-new vibrant veggie recipes (none are on the blog – you’ll only find them in the book) and lots of beautiful visuals to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>I get so many questions about how to cook spaghetti squash, so I thought I’d share my go-to method for roasting it, a few tips, and a couple of my favorite spaghetti squash recipes. How to Cook Spaghetti Squash First thing’s first: use a sharp knife to cut it in half lengthwise. After you slice the squash in half, use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Next, drizzle the insides lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. I find that adding too much oil and too much salt at this stage makes the squash a bit…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s an understatement to say that we really love tea. We drink more tea in our household than all other beverages combined. Green tea, hibiscus tea, and fennel tea are some of our regulars, but this post is about 3 new (to me) teas that I’ve started incorporating into my daily routine over the last few weeks. We’re partnering with Traditional Medicinals on this post because their teas are so wonderful. My obsession with Traditional Medicinals started years ago. I was feeling under the weather and my throat needed some support. My mom told me “you have to try this…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>It’s sushi day! You might be wondering – why the heck would you roll sushi at home when it’s so much easier to order it at a restaurant? Because this maki sushi recipe is fun, affordable, and way more fresh than take-out sushi… but the best part is that you can get creative about what you choose to fill your rolls with. No more cucumber-only veggie sushi rolls! These maki sushi rolls are filled with savory roasted shiitake mushrooms, avocado, cucumber, and red cabbage for crunch & color. There’s also a fun dipping sauce – the carrot ginger dressing from…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Kale salad recipes aren’t as trendy as they used to be, but I’m still making them, and I think you should be too. My case in point is this&nbsp;kale salad recipe, which, if I do say so myself, is one of the most delicious ways to eat kale. A vibrant carrot ginger dressing coats the tender leafy greens, and roasted chickpeas, colorful veggies, and avocado add lots of contrasting textures. I love to serve it as a side dish because it pairs well with almost any meal, but it’s also hearty enough to pass as a standalone lunch. The sturdy…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s Saturday…if you have friends coming over for dinner but you don’t feel like spending all day in the kitchen, I’ve got just the thing for you: this super delicious baked feta recipe. It comes together in no time, you can serve it as an easy appetizer or the main meal, and it’s saucy, comforting, and flavorful. What’s not to love? This recipe is inspired by a baked feta recipe from the book Cook90 by David Tamarkin, the editor and digital director of Epicurious. It’s a great book that’s full of accessible, easy-to-prepare dishes. I was drawn to this recipe…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This noodle bowl is one of my favorite “bowl food” recipes. “Bowl food” always has a mix of delicious veggie-heavy ingredients with varying tastes, textures, and flavors, with a hearty base underneath. It’s fun to eat because you get something a little different in each bite. The inconvenient thing about component bowls is that all those components can take time to prepare. Chopping and cooking raw plant-based ingredients is time-consuming! This Sesame Orange Noodle Bowl is the exception, though. You’ll be surprised how quickly and easily it comes together!

The question of the day isn’t “what am I having for breakfast or lunch,” it’s “what are we working on and can it be considered a meal?” In December, testing cookie recipes every day was a bit of a sugar rush. After that, balance was restored while testing/creating this healthy nourishing veggie noodle miso soup recipe. I think I ate this soup four times in a row last week – so what you’re looking at is my unintentional soup cleanse.

Well, we had a nice dinner and then slept through the new year for (I think) the second year in a row. The thing is – I’ve become a morning person. It wasn’t intentional – it just happened. On weekdays, I find that I get my best work done first thing in the morning. On weekends and holidays, I like to get up, pour coffee, and bake something for breakfast. So here are some yummy lemon muffins that I’ve been baking lately!
