In August 2022, Its_onsite posted <a href=#>on their IG</a>. They wrote, “Wow, Chrisean Rock’s older brother speaks out about Chrisean’s and Blueface’s toxic, abusive relationship. He says that he is hurting for his sister and that he refuses to just sit back and watch Blueface continuously humiliate her over the internet. Swipe.”</p><p>He wrote, “Chrisean I Love You so much, and over here hurting bout you, I don’t say nothing wasn’t goin to until u introduced us in person cause the sh*t he be doin on the internet to you c’mon Chrisean.
