As a child, she studied classical guitar and was mentored by one of that field's great performers, Andres Segovia. As a teenager, she was discovered by Latin bandleader and "Rumba King" Xavier Cugat, and she soon joined his orchestra as a singer and dancer. Despite a more than 40-year age difference, Charo and Cugat wed in 1966.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="TV Star: 'Ed Sullivan' to 'Chico and the Man' and 'The Love Boat'" data-anchor-id=tv-star-ed-sullivan-to-chico-and-the-man-and-the-love-boat class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">TV Star: 'Ed Sullivan' to 'Chico and the Man' and 'The Love Boat'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Charo appeared with Cugat and alone on The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/a89443853/ed-sullivan/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ed Sullivan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ed Sullivan</a> Show several times in the late 1960s. In Las Vegas, she initially performed with her husband and later developed her own popular nightclub act.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After making her film debut in Tiger by the Tail (1968), with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a49114382/tippi-hedren/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tippi Hedren" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tippi Hedren</a>, Charo began to break out on her own through guest appearances on such shows as Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, The Carol Burnett Show and The Hollywood Squares. She was also a regular guest on The Tonight Show with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/a72896014/johnny-carson/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Johnny Carson." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Johnny Carson.</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although she was a versatile performer, Charo became best known for her bubbly personality and bombshell looks. She could often be heard uttering her famous catchphrase, "Cuchi-cuchi," which was usually accompanied by a wiggle of the hips. The phrase came from a childhood pet, a dog named Cuchillo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Near the end of the decade, Charo seemed to be everywhere. On television, she had her own special in 1976 and appeared on the comedy Chico and the Man, with comedian Freddie Prinze, for a season. She went on to a recurring role on The Love Boat that stretched for several years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with her acting, Charo released several records, including La Salsa (1976) and Dance a Little Bit Closer (1978).</p><h2 data-node-id=16 title="Later Albums and TV Career" data-anchor-id=later-albums-and-tv-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Later Albums and TV Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Charo returned to performing and to her beloved guitar for 1994's Guitar Passion, which did well on the Latin charts. She also attracted a new generation of fans through the VH1 reality show The Surreal Life. And while she remained famous for her humorous stage persona, she was also taken more seriously as a serious performer, receiving positive reviews for her album Charo and Guitar (2005).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following years of scattered TV appearances, Charo in 2017 was named a contestant on the 24th season of Dancing with the Stars. That year she also appeared in the farcical Sharknado 5: Global Swarming, as the queen of England.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 title="Personal Life" data-anchor-id=personal-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Charo divorced Cugat in 1978 and married Kjell Rasten that same year. Not long after the birth of their son, Shel Joseph, in 1982, they moved to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Focused on her family, she mostly performed locally and owned a restaurant aptly named Charo's.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In February 2019, Rasten died after reportedly shooting himself at their Beverly Hills home.
