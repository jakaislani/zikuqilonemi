His following film, Strays, screened at Sundance. Diesel’s work attracted the attention of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/steven-spielberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steven Spielberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Steven Spielberg</a>, who cast the actor in Saving Private Ryan (1998). He starred in several films before landing his career-defining role in The Fast and the Furious (2001). Additional films include The Chronicles of Riddick (2004), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and later chapters of the Furious franchise.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Vin Diesel was born Mark Vincent on July 18, 1967, in Alameda County, California. Diesel and his twin brother, Paul, were raised by their mother Delora and their stepfather, Irving H. Vincent. Their biological father split from their mother before they were born.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Not one to reveal details about his personal background, Diesel has been candid about developing a passion for performing early on. His stepfather was a drama teacher and Diesel himself started acting at the age of 7 at the Theater for the New City. "I've always been certain that I was going to be a movie star," he told Entertainment Weekly. "Even as a kid I knew it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Diesel continued to act in theatrical productions throughout his adolescence. During his teen years, he also took up another occupation—club bouncer. This job helped him develop a toughness that he has carried through many of his film performances. As he explained to Men's Fitness, "I must have been in more than 500 fights. I fought every night, and I bounced for nine or 10 years. And these weren't pretty fights."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Working as a bouncer also left his days free to audition for roles and study English at New York's Hunter College. Diesel drew inspiration from his days as a struggling actor for his first self-made film project — an enterprise that helped launch his career.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Vin Diesel Movies</h2><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Multi-Facial,' 'Strays'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Diesel dropped out of college in order to create his first film, Multi-Facial. Diesel wrote, produced, directed and starred in this short film about an actor willing to play any ethnicity in order to work. The film was accepted and screened at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival in 1995. Diesel next directed, wrote and starred in the full-length feature Strays, in which he played a tough, hard-edged drug dealer learning how to open himself up to emotional intimacy. The work screened at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Saving Private Ryan,' 'Pitch Black'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Diesel's work attracted the attention of famed director Steven Spielberg, who was then starting work on his World War II epic Saving Private Ryan (1998). Spielberg tailored a featured part for the actor and, following the movie's release, Diesel found big-budget opportunities coming his way. In 2000, he turned in a noted performance in the science-fiction thriller Pitch Black. His character, Richard B. Riddick, went on to appear in two sequels: The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) and Riddick (2013).</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Boiler Room,' 'The Fast and the Furious,' 'XXX'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Showing his talent for serious dramatic fare, Diesel joined <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ben-affleck data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ben Affleck" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ben Affleck</a> and Giovanni Ribisi as a crooked stockbroker in Boiler Room (2000). But he soon became better known for helping to launch one of the era's most popular action franchises in 2001 with The Fast and the Furious. In the film, Diesel played notorious street racer Dominic Toretto, who is investigated by an undercover cop (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/paul-walker data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paul Walker" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Paul Walker</a>). His status as a star in the action genre was further cemented by Diesel's leading role in XXX (2002).</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Pacifier,' 'Find Me Guilty,' 'Furious' Sequels</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Diesel later sought to broaden his image, taking on the 2005 comedy The Pacifier. For 2006's Find Me Guilty, he let his famous fit physique go to play a mobster who defends himself at trial. But Diesel was soon back to his popular tough guy persona with later installments of the Fast and Furious franchise, including Fast & Furious (2009), Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013) and Furious 7 (2015), the last of which was marred by Walker's death in a car accident before filming was complete.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Voicing Groot for 'Guardians of the Galaxy'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2014, Diesel joined a new franchise as the voice of Groot, a tree-like being with a three-word vocabulary, in the sci-fi adventure Guardians of the Galaxy. The offbeat superhero flick became an international blockbuster that grossed around $770 million, with Guardians of the Galaxy 2 (2017) going on to enjoy an even bigger haul at the global box office. Diesel also voiced Groot for appearances in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019) and Ralph Breaks the Internet (2019).</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Last Witch Hunter,' 'Bloodshot'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2015, Diesel starred with Elijah Wood and Michael Caine in The Last Witch Hunter, a project which drew largely negative reviews and modest box office returns. Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk (2016) also failed to impress critics despite its innovative visuals, but Diesel found a welcome reception with his revival of familiar characters in 2017's XXX: Return of Xander Cage and The Fate of the Furious. The action star then debuted a new butt-kicking character in Bloodshot (2020), based on the comics about a revenge-minded solider enhanced with nanotechnology.</p><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Vin Diesel</li><li>Birth Year: 1967</li><li>Birth date: July 18, 1967</li><li>Birth State: California</li><li>Birth City: Alameda</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Vin Diesel is an actor known for action movies such as 'The Chronicles of Riddick' and 'The Fast and the Furious' franchise.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Action</li><li>Drama</li><li>Comedy</li><li>Sci-fi</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Cancer</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Hunter College</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=27><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Vin Diesel Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/vin-diesel</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 24, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=32 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>When you grow up in New York City, you have to decide at a young age whether you're going to be predator or prey.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwwsinZJ2hlaiyrQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./youtube-apologized-to-lofi-girl-after-her-channel-was-taken-down-due-to-false-copyright-claim.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="YouTube Apologized To Lofi Girl After Her Channel Was Taken Down Due To False Copyright Claim">&larr;
