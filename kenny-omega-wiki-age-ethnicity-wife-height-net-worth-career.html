In addition, he made his Premier Championship Wrestling debut in 2001.</p><p>For two years, he wrestled for TRCW, developing the gimmick of a Hawaiian surfer named Kenny Omega. He graduated from TCI Transcona Collegiate Institute in 2001 and enrolled in university but dropped out during his first year to focus solely on professional wrestling.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kenny-omega-height-weight></span>Kenny Omega Height, Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He’s a very attractive and energetic wrestler. He is 6 feet tall.

A year later, he won gold in the company. Omega worked for several independent promotions throughout his career, earning him the title of “Best Wrestler Ever.” Omega made his PWG debut in 2008, winning the PWG World Championship at the Battle of Los Angeles event.</p><p>He defeated Ryusuke Taguchi at Wrestle Kingdom 9 to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship for the first time. The stable turned on AJ Styles after Kingdom match 10 and crowned Omega as their leader. Omega defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi at The New Beginning in Niigata to win the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. He and The Young Bucks won the NEVER Open weight 6-Man Tag Team Championship less than a week later.</p><p>After defeating Michael Elgin, Jay Lethal, and Tomohiro Ishii in an eight-man tournament, Omega has crowned the inaugural IWGP United States Champion at G1 Special. Omega began working with Adam Page, a hangman. On Jericho’s cruise, they defeated SCU for the AEW World Tag Team Championship. They faced a number of opponents prior to their split as a result of Page’s storyline alcoholism. At All Out 2020, the duo lost the AEW World Tag Team Championship to FTR.</p><p>Omega has been the Impact World Champion since 2020, when he defeated Rich Swann. Christian Cage dethroned him after a few months. Omega faced a number of challenges during his reign as champion.

He appears to be single, however. Smith has been experiencing vertigo since 2018. One of his closest friends is Michael Nakazawa, a fellow professional wrestler, and former tag team partner. Smith is fluent in Japanese and lived in Tokyo’s east end’s Katsushika Ward in August 2018.</p><p>Smith told ESPN.com in October 2016 that he “liked Japanese culture before even realizing it was, in fact, Japanese culture” and that Japanese video games and cartoons were his favorites. He has since become a Japanese citizen. Smith stated in 2016 that he had little time to think about relationships outside of wrestling because he was so focused on his wrestling goals.</p><p>Smith, a self-described video game enthusiast, created the Cleaner’s Corner YouTube series in which he played some of his favorite games. In his spare time, he attends video game conventions. On June 26, 2016, he made a surprise appearance at Community Effort Orlando.</p><p>In a round of Street Fighter V, he defeated fellow professional wrestler Xavier Woods. Smith played Cody Travers in 2018. In Full Gear 2021, Omega was defeated by Hangman Adam Page. Omega has officially taken a break and was written off due to a number of injuries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKOVo7u6ec6mnKCZXay2rLWMmp6eZZWpta%2B1wqKrsmWnnrOmeceeoKCgpGK7psCMsKarrJhisKK%2BxJ6paA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./intel-z77-panther-point-chipset-and-motherboard-preview-asrock-asus-gigabyte-msi-ecs-and-biostar.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LucidLogix Virtu MVP Technology - Intel Z77 Panther Point Chipset and Motherboard Preview  ASRock">&larr;
