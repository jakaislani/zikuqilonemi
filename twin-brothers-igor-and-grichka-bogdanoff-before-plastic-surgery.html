The brothers were the hosts of the TV show Temps X.</p><p>The Bogdanoffs are famous identical twins from France. By profession, they are television presenters, essayists, and producers. They have been presenting on subjects in science fiction, popular science, and cosmology since the 70s on TV.</p><p>The brothers came to the limelight with the TV series, Temps X, released in 1979. The duo hosted programs on science and science fiction. They introduced English and American sci-fi series to the French public including The Prisoner, Star Trek, and Doctor Who.</p><p>The Bogdanoff brothers gained a lot of public attention following the facial surgery in the late 1990s. The medical procedure deformed their face to the extent of being unrecognizable which attracted a lot of criticism from the public.</p><p>The family nation team has written on other popular twins who have undergone plastic surgery including Clermont Twins from Bleached Skin and The Capasso Triplets from Extreme Sisters.</p><h2 id=igor-and-grichka-bogdanoff-before-and-after-plastic-surgery><span class=ez-toc-section id=igor-and-grichka-bogdanoff-before-and-after-plastic-surgery></span> Igor And Grichka Bogdanoff Before and After Plastic Surgery<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Igor And Grichka Bogdanoff before and after plastic surgery has a stark difference in their appearance. The brothers received heavy criticism for undergoing the medical procedure.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The two brothers started to undergo surgery and implants during the late 1990s. They looked completely different as they entered their 60s.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The public has been on the critical side regarding their decision to have a face makeover. The photo comparison of before and after the surgery of the twin brothers has been a trend on Twitter.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>One of the Twitter users @Tom_TheSequel posted a collage of the Bogdanoff twins and wrote that he was both fascinated and terrified of them.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Another user @</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">OctopusCaveman </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>went as far as saying that the twins used to be so handsome.

The brothers insisted the changes resulted from working with unspecified technologies.</p><p>However, the Bogdanoffs themselves never publicly admitted the fact that they underwent plastic surgery. They claimed it to be experimentation.</p><p>The Bogdanoffs lived a sophisticated lifestyle. Other than questionable research on quantum physics, the brothers earned a reputation for extreme plastic surgery.</p><p>The public was captivated by the length Bogdanoffs went to with the surgery. They extensively used Botox, lip filler, and chin sculpting not once but twice, in the 1900s and in the 2000s.</p><p>These surgeries resulted in a huge change in their appearance so and so that they were rendered almost unrecognizable. Some people even labeled them as aliens.</p><p>In 2010, the brothers said in a public statement that they were proud to have faces like extra-terrestrials.</p><p>They had prominent cheekbones and chins. The Sydney Morning Herald described their chins as high and bulbous that appear to threaten their owner’s vision. The article further added that their appearance at the Cannes Film Festival caused a stir around the world.</p><h2 id=igor-and-grichka-bogdanoff-now><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-are-igor-and-grichka-bogdanoff-now></span> Where Are Igor And Grichka Bogdanoff Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff now rest in peace at Saint-Lary cemetery in southwestern France.
